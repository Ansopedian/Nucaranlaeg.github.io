        <h4>Wounds</h4>
        <p>
            A creature takes wounds whenever they would take damage that would leave them below 0 HP
            or they are hit by critical hits.  Any excess damage (and all damage from critical hits)
            is divided by 5+Con (round fractions up) and taken as wounds.  Critical hits do not
            increase damage dealt.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever a creature takes one or more wound, they must make a death saving throw.
            On a failure, they fall unconscious.
        </p>
        <h4>Death Saving Throws</h4>
        <p>
            Death saving throws have a DC equal to the total number of wounds the creature has.
            The only modifier to death saving throws is the creature's constitution.
        </p>
        <h4>Unconsciousness</h4>
        <p>
            When a creature is unconscious, on their turn they must roll a death saving throw.
            On a failure, the creature dies.
