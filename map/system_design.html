        <h4>Wounds</h4>
        <p>
            A creature takes wounds whenever they would take damage that would leave them below 0 HP
            or they are hit by critical hits.  Any excess damage (and all damage from critical hits)
            is divided by 5+Con (round fractions up) and taken as wounds.  Critical hits do not
            increase damage dealt.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a creature has 9 health, +2 Con, and is hit by a 12 damage crit.  It drops to 0 health
            and takes (3+12)/(5+2)=15/7=3 wounds.  It only falls unconscious if it fails its death
            saving throw.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever a creature takes one or more wound, they must make a death saving throw.
            On a failure, they fall unconscious.
        </p>
        <h4>Death Saving Throws</h4>
        <p>
            Death saving throws have a DC equal to the total number of wounds the creature has.
            The only modifier to death saving throws is the creature's constitution.
        </p>
        <h4>Unconsciousness</h4>
        <p>
            When a creature is unconscious, on their turn they must roll a death saving throw.
            On a failure, the creature dies.
        </p>
        <p>
            An unconscious creature can be stabilized by rolling a natural 20 on a death saving throw,
            recieving healing equal to one point per wound (for that purpose - it heals no hit points),
            or having an ally succeed on a healing check with DC 5+wounds.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h1 onclick="collapseSection(this)">Advantage</h1>
        <hr>
        <h4>Stacking Advantage</h4>
        <p>
            Advantage now stacks!  To determine your total Advantage, add the number of sources
            of Advantage you have and subtract the sources of Disadvantage.  If the total is +2
            or more, add the total to your roll.  If the total is -2 or less, subtract the total
            from your roll.
        </p>
        <h4>Feat - Overwhelming Advantage</h4>
        <p>
            If you have at least one source of Advantage on a roll and more Disadvantages than
            Advantages, subtract 2 from the number of Disadvantages you are suffering.  This
            cannot cause you to gain Advantage.  If a creature is making any roll, you have
            imposed Disadvantage on that roll, and that creature has more Advantages than
            Disadvantages, subtract 2 from the number of Advantages they have.  This cannot
            cause them to suffer Disadvantage.
        </p>
